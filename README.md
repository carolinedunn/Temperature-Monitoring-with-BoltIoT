# Temperature-Monitoring-with-BoltIoT

This project uses the BoltIoT system with included temperature sensor to monitor the temperature and send you an SMS and/or email when there is a change in temperature. The email is sent via Mailgun, and the text is sent via Twilio. Mailgun requires a credit card to create an account.

Disclaimer: I am not a data scientist, and the formula I am using to calculate z variations was pulled from here: https://www.hackster.io/iambishal/temperature-monitoring-alert-system-using-bolt-iot-98e7b9
